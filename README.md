# Metin2 Itemshop Source

Easy to setup Metin2 Itemshop System written from stratch under 4 hours, it only support free items, no payment system was integrated.
Every message is Hungarian, I no longer expect to update this repository, this is a good starting point to make your own Itemshop System, because the current ones out there are either outdated, or use old solutions which aren't safe.

Used technologies:
- PHP 7.3.19 (PDO)
- Bootstrap 4
- JQuery

Available pages:
- Login page
- Mainpage which indicates your account information and characters
- Itemshop page where you can buy free Itemshop items, after purchase you'll see them in your itemshop inventory
